      <h3>My Friend,</h3>
    
      <p>I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much your friendship means to me.</p>

      <p>Life has its ups and downs, but knowing that I have a friend like you makes the journey a lot more enjoyable. Your support, laughter, and shared moments are treasures I hold dear.</p>
    
      <p>Let's plan a get-together soon. I miss our conversations and the fun times we've had together. Looking forward to creating more memories with you.</p>
    
      <p>Take care, and until we meet again!</p>
    
      <p>Your friend,</p>
